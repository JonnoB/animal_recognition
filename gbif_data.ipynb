    "Storage is already somewhat of an issue. If I want to store anymore data I will need to buy additional storage. papersapce is $0.29 as I guess they want us to use digital ocean storage which is $0.02 GiB. The answer is pretty clear. Buy $5 month of storage from digital ocean and download a bunch of images to the storage bucket. Mount the bucket then train using the mounted bucket... I will have to find out if my symlink approach still works"

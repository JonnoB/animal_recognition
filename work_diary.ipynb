    "I finally managed to get git token working. I switched from trying to use a fine-grained token to using a classic token, and it worked as expected. This is quite a relief as it means I can easily move between paperspace and my comp, which makes a lot of the fiddling around a lot easier.\n",

    "- I need to work out how to mass download from GBIF or Inat. It appears that the gbif-dl Python library is no longer maintained, but the R library is. I am not sure if trying the R approach is going to work well with paperspace, although I could download to my comp then up to paperspace. However, a more elegant and straightforward solution would definitely be appreciated.\n",

This means that I no longer need to copy files and take up lots of space, but instead create parallel train and test folders populated by symlinks, which is much faster and much less space. This means I can have the data structures for multiple experiments without issue.\n",

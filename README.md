# Animal Recognition
Object detection on camera trap images with species recognition. This has been a long running mess of a project. I hope now I have more skill in python and the technology has moved on a bit I will be able to actually create a model that has value.

I am working on the project using paperspace and this git repo is being pulled/pushed in to my paperspace instance.

The git seems odd becuase I created a symlink of the .gitignore. Maybe I will delete this I am not sure
